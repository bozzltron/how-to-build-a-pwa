# Step 4 - Application shell
Implementing the application shell is key for the user experience.  It ensures that the user never has to look at a white screen.  The application should load immediately and allow content to trickle.  This presents an interesting problem for single page applications written with frameworks like React as the user interface is entirely generated from JavaScript.
